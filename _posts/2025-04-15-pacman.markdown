<h3>Abstract</h3>
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has demon-
strated strong performance in deterministic and
adversarial games, however its vanilla form lacks
context-awareness in complex multi-agent envi-
ronments. This paper explores the integration of
heuristic knowledge into MCTS for the UC Berke-
ley Capture the Flag variant of Pacman. We in-
vestigate several domain-informed enhancements
to the expansion and simulation phases, including
progressive bias through heuristic-based action
sorting and softmax-weighted rollouts. Addition-
ally, we implement a defensive MCTS agent to
support team-based coordination. Through sys-
tematic ablation studies and a large-scale tourna-
ment evaluated with both win rates and TrueSkill
scores, we show that incorporating heuristic strate-
gies leads to significantly more robust and effec-
tive gameplay. Our results underscore the impor-
tance of informed search in multi-agent planning
domains
